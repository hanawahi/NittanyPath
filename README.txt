To use the program:
UserLogIn: Users use the drop-down to select their affiliation (student, faculty). A session begins for the logged-in user once a successful log-in occurs.

CheckingInfo: Students and faculty are able to see personal info and change password; students can see the courses they are enrolled in and information (such as professor email, and office location).

CreatingPosts: Students, TAs and Professors are all able to view, create and comment on posts that correspond courses/sections that they are apart of. 

CreatingAssignments: Students are able to see an up-to-date assignment list (homeworks and exams). Faculty members have a very different layout where they are able to view the assignments they have assigned, view grades, or add assignments. As they add assignments, students and TAs are able to see these.

Logging out clears all session data and returns to the home page.
